# MDSR
**initial idea**

This is RP for the seminar from TUB course "HTCV-SE",my assignment is to learn the work of the paper:"Enhanced deep
residual networks for single image super-resolution".So first I' going to try to reimplement their code in pytorch, and take there official pytorch version RP(sanghyun-son:https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch) as reference.
