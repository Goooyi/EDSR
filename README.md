# EDSR
**initial idea**

This is RP for the seminar from TUB course "HTCV-SE",my assignment is to learn the work of the paper:"Enhanced deep residual networks for single image super-resolution" under the topic "single image super resolution".So first I'm going to try to reimplement their code in pytorch, and take their official pytorch version RP(sanghyun-son:https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch) as reference.

To understand the topic better,the paper "Deep Learning for Single Image Super-Resolution: A Brief Review" provide a throughout development of single image super resolution in steps. And the paper "Accurate Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Convolutional Networks" is a must-read for this specific topic "EDSR/MDSR" as it provides fundamental ideas like using multiple scales and residual learning(ResNet).
